# Heating-AI

The project idea is that residential heating is controlled by an AI. 
For example, the heating should be switched on half an hour before the first resident arrives, so that it is already warm at the time of arrival. Conversely, the heating could also be lowered half an hour before the last occupant leaves.

The training data of the AI are the presences of the persons of the last weeks. Whereby this data can be obtained from the WLAN connection data of their devices.
